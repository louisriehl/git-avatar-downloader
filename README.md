# About

The goal of this project is to create a simple command-line application that, when given a Github user and repository, will download all the avatars of the users who have contributed to the project.

## Concepts
* Get HTML data using the node request module
* Integrate the Github API to access required information
* Pipe the data using fs to download all the images into the desired directory
* Appropriately name the avatar images
